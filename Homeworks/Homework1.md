### Statistics as a branch of Math?
Statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data, or as a branch of mathematics.Some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics. While many scientific investigations make use of data, statistics is concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty.

### Statistical theory/hypothesis
Statistics theory is a mathematical approach to describe something, predict events, or analyse the relationship between things.It provides an underlying rationale and provides a consistent basis for the choice of methodology used in applied statistics. A statistical hypothesis is a hypothesis that is testable on the basis of observed data modelled as the realised values taken by a collection of random variables.

### Role of Statistics
Statistical Science is the key to life because the science of statistics can be used in all fields of science and the everyday human life. We often use statistical science for example in regulating how much expenses we are matched with the revenue that we earn, and then select the items which we will buy, and others that ultimately takes the best decision we will take.Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: biostatistics, computational biology, computational sociology, network biology, social science, sociology and social research. Some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have specialized terminology.Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes, for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions. In these roles, it is a key tool, and perhaps the only reliable tool.

### Statistics and the relationship with Cybersecurity [extra]
The early writings on statistical inference date back to Arab mathematicians and cryptographers, during the Islamic Golden Age between the 8th and 13th centuries. Al-Khalil (717â€“786) wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages, which contains the first use of permutations and combinations, to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.In his book, Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages, Al-Kindi gave a detailed description of how to use frequency analysis to decipher encrypted messages. Al-Kindi also made the earliest known use of statistical inference, while he and later Arab cryptographers developed the early statistical methods for decoding encrypted messages.
